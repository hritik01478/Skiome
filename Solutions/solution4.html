            Skiome organises a wide variety of clubs which are devoted to
            increase the skill levels of students in the field of their
            interest. These clubs conduct various workshops on a regular basis
            which would introduce students to new technologies and research work
            going on in their fields. A club would have around 20-25 students.
            Clubs which are made in schools under Skiome follow a particular
            hierarchy of professional communication, training and skill
            transfer. <br />
            The hierarchy is as follows: <br />
            <br />
            (I) →Lead (An official working in Skiome who holds the topmost
            position in that particular field of the club. She/ He acts
            according to the needs of the clubs and is the person to organise
            workshops regularly) <br />
            <br />
            (II) →Mentor (Generally a second year college student who will be
            acting as a mediator for transferring knowledge she/he learns from
            the lead and teach it to the Core members of the club) <br />
            <br />
            (III) →Core Members (A few students who are the Presidents,
            Vice-Presidents, etc. of the club whose job will be to gain
            knowledge and skills from the mentor and then transfer the same to
            all the members of the club and train them). <br />
