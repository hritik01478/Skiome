          <h1 class="primary custom_heading">Tech Development and Training</h1>
          <div class="secondary">
            This program includes development of the technological environment
            in schools. Proper training will be given to students as well as
            teachers in different fields of technologies. Skiome will ensure a
            technologically developed and advanced environment for teaching and
            learning in the school. The process will include continuous
            workshops. <br />
            <br />
            Some of the fields covered under this domain, includes: <br />
            <br />
            →Coding, Web Development, App development, UI/UX: Introduction to
            such courses would lead to the development of teams in the school
            itself which will develop and work on school websites and apps in
            future. It will also help the students who want to pursue their
            career in these fields which would give them a head-start for
            learning languages and programming. Also, we will help the students
            build their profiles on authenticated competitive coding platforms
            and environments like hackerrank, codechef, codeforces, vs code,
            blueJ, intelliJ etc. Also it will expose them to different operating
            systems like Linux, ubuntu, Windows, MacOs, etc. <br />
            <br />
            →Microsoft Office Full course with all activation keys: This will
            provide students with a comprehensive understanding of all the
            elements of Office that are accessible, many of which they are
            unaware of, but could be very useful to them in day to day life.
            <br />
            <br />
            →Computer Software + Hardware Knowledge: These would include all the
            internal machinery processes by the computer when we do simple tasks
            like web browsing, reading and writing the data, etc. Important
            keywords like registers, chips, CPU, memory, disks will be
            introduced to the students to give them an idea about the internal
            machinery working. This would also open up different paths for
            students interested in fields like robotics. <br />
            <br />
            →Editing, Manipulating, Designing etc.: Various features such as
            graphic designing, video/photo editing and after-effects are covered
            under this course. This opens up doors for fields like graphic
            designing and animation etc. Many features like Adobe premiere pro,
            Figma, Frammers, Canva, after effects, etc are provided to students
            to practise and develop their skills. <br />
            <br />
            →Simulations: Simulated labs created by Skiome will be provided to
            the students for understanding and experimenting different concepts
            of different subjects just by sitting at their homes.These
            simulations initiate the functioning of an existing process which
            play a major role when it comes to explaining/grasping topics which
            are practically not possible to demonstrate in the class. Examples
            include medical surgery, shifting of tropical belts, blood pressure
            measuring, constellation visualisation, etc. <br />
            <br />
            →Site surfing and cyber security: Under this course,students are
            taught about the different kinds of cyber threats, attacks,
            methodologies and the techniques used by the crackers to attack
            different websites and servers. They are taught about the importance
            of data management and protection. Also, in site-surfing, they are
            taught to search the data from different search engines smartly.
