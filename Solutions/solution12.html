            Skiome does not intend to or focuses on varying the present school
            curriculum, rather it helps in assisting the schoolsâ€™ system and
            making it more efficient and technologically upgraded. <br />
            <br />
            Skiome parallelly runs a system along with the schools which assists
            the teachers in teaching the concepts better by providing them
            various innovative services such as objects, models, experiments
            etc.; it also assists the students in developing their skills and
            talents by providing them services such as clubs, events, workshops,
            competitions etc. <br />
            <br />
            The services by Skiome to the schools functions in the same way a
            stick works in helping a climber to grow, i.e. we are not affecting
            the basic fundamentals of the curriculum but powering up the
            education system to a better growth rate. <br />
            <br />
            Skiome is creating an interface to provide a flow of knowledge,
            talents and skill from one school to another or one city/town to
            another through frequent interactions between the students and
            teachers of various schools. <br />
            <br />
            To do this, we are organizing various Open workshops, Educational
            events, Meetings, and Conferences on various topics, where the
            teachers and students of different participate, interact and learn
            skills from each other, providing a better flow of knowledge and
            network-building within schools.
