            3-D teaching is one of the most effective and interactive ways of
            teaching in the modern era. This makes concept learning and studying
            more interesting for the students and they take an interest in the
            topic. Skiome has a separate team which comprises members who
            continuously bring in new technologies and better 3-D models for
            more effective teaching. We also facilitate modifications in these
            models according to the teachers, which further makes them effective
            as the teachers can use their innovation in 3-D teaching to the
            fullest. Every town/city has a centre where the teachers could order
            the models according to their needs. The delivery service cycle
            repeats every 4 days. <br />
            <br />
            Some of our models include the brain model, DNA model, globe,
            mountains, layers of earth, car engine, atomic models, solar system
            models, concepts of science, etc. <br />
            <br />
            This feature mainly deals with the problem of a less interactive
            environment in the classes as the students when taught through this
            method could visualise better than those who are taught through 2-D
            methods. This builds innovation in the minds of the students which
            helps them to enhance their creativity in a proper way
