            <h2>1. What Data We Get and How We Get It</h2>
            We collect certain data of the schools from the physical form filled
            by the schools itself and the data is feeded by the Admin in the
            Database. The data of teachers of the school is provided by the
            schools within the app. The data includes mainly names, emails,
            contact numbers, posts, addresses, photos, etc.
            <h2>2. What We Use Your Data For</h2>
            We use your data to do things like provide our Services, communicate
            with you, troubleshoot issues, secure against fraud and abuse,
            improve and update our Services, analyze how people use our
            Services, serve personalized advertising, and as required by law or
            necessary for safety and integrity. We retain your data for as long
            as it is needed to serve the purposes for which it was collected.
            <h2>3. Who We Share Your Data With</h2>
            We share certain data about you with instructors, other schools,
            companies performing services for us, Skiome affiliates, our
            business partners, analytics and data enrichment providers, your
            social media providers, companies helping us run promotions and
            surveys, and advertising companies who help us promote our Services.
            We may also share your data as needed for security, legal
            compliance, or as part of a corporate restructuring. Lastly, we can
            share data in other ways if it is aggregated or de-identified or if
            we get your consent.
            <h2>4. Security</h2>
            We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of
            data being stored. As with any internet-enabled system, there is
            always a risk of unauthorized access, so it’s important to protect
            your password and to contact us if you suspect any unauthorized
            access to your account.
            <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
            You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the
            ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies, and collection of
            your data by certain third parties. You can update or terminate your
            account from within our Services, and can also contact us for
            individual rights requests about your personal data. Parents who
            believe we’ve unintentionally collected personal data about their
            underage child should contact us for help deleting that information.
            <h2>6. Updates & Contact Info</h2>
            When we make a material change to this policy, we’ll notify users
            via email, in-product notice, or another mechanism required by law.
            Changes become effective the day they’re posted. Please contact us
            via email or postal mail with any questions, concerns, or disputes.
